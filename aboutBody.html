                     <i><b>Simply Cannabis.</b></i><br/><br/>
                     At Empire we are striving to remove the negative stigma surrounding the cannabis plant.  We believe, as many of you believe, 
                     that for far too long the cannabis plant has been demeaned, destroyed, and degraded by those whose interests were in the 
                     prohibition of cannabis.  Empire means to remove all of these negative impressions.<br/><br/>  
                     
                     We are not just a 'weed' company.  We are not just another bag of flower.  We are not just here for profit.   
                     Empire exists to make a difference in our family’s lives as well as yours.  We aim to deliver not just a good 
                     high or a good buzz, but to have a quality experience.   Our goal is to provide a plethora of offerings in a 
                     wide range of cannabinoid profiles and develop the correct entourage of blends to provide you with the medicine you need.<br/><br/>
                     
                     We are developing unique offerings in CBN, CBD, Delta 9, Delta 8 and CBG products. Our mission is to develop 
                     full spectrum products from the entire plant.   Empire believes that a full spectrum approach, through 
                     rigorous research and development, can cure all that ails us and those closest to us. In the near future, 
                     we see cannabis as an answer and  a solution to not one ailment or one psychosis but to a wealth of human and 
                     environmental issues.<br/><br/>
                     
                     Whether it’s flower, pre-rolls, oils, tinctures, capsules or topicals – it’s pesticide free. When tested, 
                     all our products test metal-free.  We take our cannabis and our mission seriously.   We think of our customers as our 
                     family and that makes every test and every product important to us.  Empire was one of the first in the state to be 
                     medically compliant.  We continue to strive to have the cleanest and safest cannabis around.<br/><br/>
                     
                     At Empire, our team believes – it is <i>simply cannabis</i> made to simply improve all our lives;  it is <i>simply cannabis</i> 
                     made simply, without any added chemicals or pesticides;  it is simply – <b>Empire’s clean full spectrum cannabis.</b><br/><br/>
                     
                     Thank you for being a part of our journey.  Empire appreciates you visiting and supporting us. Please feel 
                     free to ask how you can join us on our journey.<br/><br/>

                  Empire uses simple and sustainable farming techniques to grow Washington cannabis in 
                  Washington soil, under the Washington sun.<br/><br/>
                  Our SUN, EARTH, & WATER philosophy allows our cannabis plants to be rich in the same 
                  dynamic and full spectrum of cannabinoids one will find in our oils.  Our farm thrives 
                  in harmony with the Central Columbia River Basin, without having a negative impact on 
                  its highly active ecosystem or its resources.<br/><br/>
                  Empires oils are thoughtfully extracted for you and your loved ones using pesticide-free, 
                  homegrown cannabis from our family owned farm. We don’t outsource cannabis plants, oil or 
                  other materials because we care about what's in your cannabis oils.
